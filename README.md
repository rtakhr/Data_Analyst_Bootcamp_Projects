# DataCamp1_Projects
This is my collection of notes, projects, and resources from the Data Analyst Bootcamp from Alex the Analyst's Youtube channel.

This bootcamp rekindled my passion to study purely data analyst. I have always had the knack for analyzing and discussing data,
trends, and their valuable opportunities. I had so much fun and amazement discovering all beginner tips and tricks in using the covered
applications for analysis, database, and visualization. 

The project consists of direct and concies guides on using beginner to advanced SQL, Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, and Python. At the end of each subtopics, there were also projects based on real-life applications, which I also have included in this repository for easy viewing and access.

Skills learned:
  -SQL (SQL Server, MySQL)
  -Excel (VLookup, Conditional Formatting, Pivot Tables)
  -Tableau
  -Microsoft Power BI
  -Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib)

Special thanks to Alex Freberg for the amazing content and inspiration!
